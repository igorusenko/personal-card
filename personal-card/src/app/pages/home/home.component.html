          <p>Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr themes and tumbled head first into the
            rabbit hole of coding and web development. Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of building
            software for an advertising agency, a start-up, a student-led design studio, and a huge corporation.</p>
          <p> My main focus these days is building products and leading projects for our clients at Upstatement. I most
            enjoy building software in the sweet spot where design and engineering meet — things that look good but are
            also built well under the hood. In my free time, I've also released an online video course that covers
            everything you need to know to build a web app with the Spotify API.</p>
          <p> When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually rock climbing, reading, hanging out with my wife and two cats,
            or running around Hyrule searching for Korok seeds</p>
