              <p>Hello, back in 2020, I decided to test my skills in creating my own mini websites using Html / Css / JS,
                and from that moment on, I plunged headfirst into the rabbit hole of coding and web development. Fast
                forward to today: I have been honored with the opportunity to develop software for government projects,
                complex systems, and HRM applications.</p>
              <p> Currently, my focus lies in crafting products and implementing large-scale government projects that
                demand exceptional quality, as these projects represent the face of the country. What I enjoy most is
                creating software where design meets engineering â€” things that look good but are also well-engineered
                under the hood. In my free time, I also explore new technologies and try to implement them in my pet
                projects.</p>
              <p> When I'm not at the computer, you'll usually find me at the gym, playing basketball, walking my
                dachshund, or spending time with family.</p>
